# NodeJS Express Server with Typescript and Mongoose

This is a proper implementation of an express server coupled with mongoose and JWT for authentications.

## History

Its based on earlier project I was undertaking when learning more about nodeJS and express. As the project grew in size I shifted part of it here and reorganized it to what it is now a simple but highly effective, complete implementation that can be easily modified or extended to serve certain purposes.

## API Endpoints

The server app has a total of 4 endpoints

### Jobs API

### Tasks API

### Products API

### Auth API

The server also features a template error handler for catching all thrown errros and also parsing them to display meaningful error information
